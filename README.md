## "Why not use Vagrant?"

❌ It's scope of use-cases is too large  
❌ It's ancient (lots of technical debt)  
❌ It adds layer of unnecessary abstraction  
❌ It wasn't conceived with `cloud-init` in mind  
❌ It doesn't play nice with WSL2  
❌ It has a screwed up network model  
❌ It isn't a single executable    
❌ It's in Ruby
